# Notebooks Folder

## Content Explanation:

This folder contains brief exploratory data analyses for the data sets and method result visualizations. We labeled each exploratory data analysis with "Data Summary" and the name of the data set it refers to. These files contain a short explanation of the data set structures and the variables included in the method implementation. We also provide descriptive visualizations for the variables.

## How to Navigate Folder:

**Optional:** Since this the goal for this project is implementation, the data summary files are optional to examine. They provide insights into the data sets utilized in the project, but they are not essential to the project's purpose. We provide them as a courtesy for those interested in learning slightly more about the data sets.
