# Notebooks Folder

## Content Explanation:

This folder contains brief exploratory data analyses for the data sets and method result visualizations. We labeled each exploratory data analysis with "Data Summary" and the name of the data set it refers to. These files contain a short explanation of the data set structures and the variables included in the method implementation. We also provide descriptive visualizations for the variables. The "method results" file contains visualizations for the run time results for the method-produced data set and the non-method data set. This file contains visualizations included in the project report.

## How to Navigate Folder:

The most important file in this folder is the "method results" file. We advise the reader to open and examine this file first.

**Optional:** Since this the goal for this project is implementation, the data summary files are optional to examine. They provide insights into the data sets utilized in the project, but they are not essential to the project purpose. We provide them as a courtesy for those interested in learning slightly more about the data sets.
