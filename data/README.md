# Project Data Sets

This directory contains the data sets that we utilize in the least mean squares corset algorithm and the least means squares corset++ algorithm. We provided general information and references for the data sets below:

1. Sharma, Dev (2021, May). Car Purchasing Data, Version 1(United States). Retrieved May 10, 2021 from https://www.kaggle.com/dev0914sharma/car-purchasing-model. 

*Details*: This data set contains 500 observations and 9 total columns. Some included fields are customer age, credit card debt, and annual salary.

*Details*: This data set contains 1,330,816 observations and 13 total columns. Some included fields are coolant temperature, voltage, and current. We split this file into 5 smaller files to reduce the file size.


## Important Notes: 
The "total columns" listed in this document do not refer to the columns we used in the algorithms. To see the number of columns used in the algorithms, see the *STA208_Report.pdf* or the *Data Summary* jupyter notebooks.
