# Code Folder

## Content Explanation:

In this folder, the files contain functions that we use in the LMS coreset implementation. These files contain data importing, cleaning, and standardizing. The code also includes functions to implement the algorithm and fit the LMS solvers.

## How to Navigate Folder:

We list each file in the order their functions occur in the algorithm implementation file. If we list files underneath a step, this means that we use those files' contents in the current step file.
